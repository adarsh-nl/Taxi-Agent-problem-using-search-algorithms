# Taxi-Agent-problem-using-search-algorithms

Taxi Agent problem implemented for Indian capital cities. The system works in such a way that given any initial city and goal city, it will return the optimal cost and route of reaching it. The system uses search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, UCS, and Astar to find the given destination with cost optimality. GeoPy is the library used to calculate the Straight Line Distance (Heuristic cost) for the Astar algorithm. The latitude and longitude data for cities has been taken from simple maps.

Thanks to Dr. Subu Kandasamy sir for guiding me through the entire process.
